## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
If you are here, it is likely because you got my resume ðŸ˜„.

I am Gabriel Vasquez, a Computer Engineering Co-op 4th year student. CompTIA Security+ certified, I am deeply interested in low-level coding and securing applications, networks, and hardware. I consider teamwork, discipline, and problem-solving my greatest assets.

I always ensure my projects are: **scalable**, **secure**, **clean**, **efficient**, and **functional**. 

## I'm currently working on...
- Developing virtual reality applications in Unity game engine and C# for engineering-related applications. 
- Creating Python and C++ command-line tools for automating offline network traffic analysis.
